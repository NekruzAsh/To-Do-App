# What I learned
* Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and using 'useState' hooks with JavaScript to keep track of the input value, the list of to-do items, and the editing state.
* Using React basic components and props to manage and pass data between components.
* Applying dynamic styling with DaisyUI based on the length of the notes and ensuring a responsive design.
* Using ternary operators and event handlers.





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
